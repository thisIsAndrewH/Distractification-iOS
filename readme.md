# Distractification-iOS: A Slack Message Counter for iOS #

**Goal:** To gain a better understanding of how often messages are sent in a given day or week.

## Features
* Queries message count of last week and last day.
* Alert when config token is missing. Prevents running app.
* Reminder to check on your status. Feature disabled by default.
* Alert when you've gone over the message limit for a given day (in config).
* Allow user to set API Key in Settings - no longer need to use config file.

## How To
To run this app, you must create a test API token from the Slack development page. [https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth-test-tokens](https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth-test-tokens) (Future OAuth TBD.)

Add your token to the Config.swift file before running.
